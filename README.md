# Kickball-App
Meant for a "score keeper" in a baseball or kickball game. Allows user to create players, keep track of score, stats, and more!

This is an Android app that I made working as an intern at Bushel. Since, I developed this project on company time, I cannot share the code I wrote. 
However, I have attached screenshots of the application to show how the app functions.

The Fargo Kickball app allows the user to:

  -Add players to a roster
  
  -Choose players from the roster to join the lineup
  
  -Start a game
  
      -Keep score
      
      -Keep track of innings
      
      -Automatically creates a batting order
      
      -Track whether the players get a hit or get out
      
      -Track whether the players have an error or get an out
      
  -View each players statistics
  
  -View the teams overall statistics
  
  -Automatically add a player using a biometrics fingerprint scanner
  
  -Share the roster with another user through the QR code functionality
  
  -Delete the roster, lineup, or statistics
